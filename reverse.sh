# Reverse Engineering Test Report for SecTrans

## Tools Used
1. Command: objdump -d sectrans > disassembled.txt
2. Command: grep -E '^[0-9a-f]+ <[^>]+>:' disassembled.txt > functions_raw.txt
3. Command: grep -E "strcat|strcpy|printf|sscanf|encrypt|decrypt|sha256|auth" functions_raw.txt > critical_functions.txt

## Observations
The following critical functions were identified during the reverse engineering process:

$(cat critical_functions.txt)

## Recommendations
1. Replace unsafe string functions with their safer alternatives (e.g., strcpy -> strncpy, strcat -> strncat).
2. Validate all inputs for functions like sscanf and printf.
3. Review all cryptographic implementations to ensure compliance with industry standards.
4. Test the application with fuzzing tools to identify additional vulnerabilities.

## Next Steps
- Replace insecure functions in the source code.
- Conduct fuzzing tests to validate the application's robustness.
- Use a static analysis tool like \`cppcheck\` to detect remaining vulnerabilities.
